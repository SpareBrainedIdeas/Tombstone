Spare Brained Ideas ran a pair of newsletters that compiled Blog Posts and YouTube uploads (earlier Twitter posts, since there used to be an API for that) from around the community.

These are still maintained privately:

- [Daily](https://app.mailbrew.com/JeremyVyska/fresh-cup-o-msdyn365bc-fINwxpNjsVFX) Newsletter of Blog Posts and YouTube Videos
- [Weekly](https://app.mailbrew.com/JeremyVyska/fresh-pot-o-msdyn365bc-pBu9HzzxBQmE) Newsletter of Blog Posts and YouTube Videos 

They are also fed from a Community Calendar, and you can easily ask to be included on upcoming editions.
